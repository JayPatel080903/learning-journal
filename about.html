                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing my **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** at the University for the
                    Creative Arts. My academic journey is fueled by a deep-seated passion for **technology** and, more
                    specifically, a strong interest in **web development**. I believe in creating innovative,
                    functional, and user-friendly digital experiences.
                </p>

                <h3>My Journey & Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    When I'm not focused on coursework or coding projects, I enjoy the continuous process of **learning
                    new programming languages** and diving into a good book. This commitment to continuous learning is
                    central to my professional aspirations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My ultimate professional goal is to become a skilled **Software Engineer** where I can contribute
                    meaningfully to innovative, challenging, and collaborative projects that push the boundaries of
                    technology.
                </p>
